# FundingCrypto

FundingCrypto is a Web 3.0-based cryptocurrency sending website built using React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Solidity, and Metamask. This project was inspired by JS Mastery, and is a great way to learn how to build a real Web 3.0 application from start to finish.

## Features

- Send cryptocurrency using Metamask
- transaction handling using Solidity
- Modern and responsive user interface built using React.js and Tailwind CSS
- Fast development and bundling using Vite

## Getting Started

To get started with FundingCrypto, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project directory.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

## Usage

To use FundingCrypto, you will need to have Metamask installed and set up in your browser. You will also need to have some cryptocurrency in your Metamask wallet.

Once you have Metamask set up, you can use FundingCrypto to send to any address cryptocurrency. Simply connect to your Metamask wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button, and you will be able to see your wallet balance and transaction history. To send cryptocurrency, enter the recipient's address and the amount you want to send, and then confirm the transaction using Metamask.

## Solidity Smart Contract

FundingCrypto uses a Solidity smart contract to handle cryptocurrency transactions. The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network, and interacts with the front-end using the web3.js library.
